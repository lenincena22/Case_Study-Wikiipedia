            <b>India</b>, officially the <b>Republic of India</b> (<i>Bharat Ganarajya</i>),is a country in
            South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country
            (with over)1.2 billion people and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded
            by the <a href="">Indian Ocean</a> on the south, the <a href="">Arabian Sea</a> on the southwest, and the Bay of
            Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders withPakistan to the west; China, Nepal,
            and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the
            Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka . India's <a href="">Andaman and Nicobar Islands</a> 
            share a maritime border with Thailand and <a href="">Indonesia</a> and <a href="">Maldives</a>
        </p>
        <p>
           The Indian subcontinent was home to the urban Indus Valley Civilisation of the 3rd
            millennium BCE. In the following millennium, the oldest scriptures associated with
            Hinduism began to be composed. Social stratification, based on caste, emerged in
            the first millennium BCE, and Buddhism and Jainism arose.A nationalist movement
            emerged in the late 19th century, which later, under Mahatma Gandhi , was noted
            for nonviolent resistance and led to India's independence in 1947.

            In 2016, a survey on World Tourism rankings compiled by United Nations World
            Tourism Organization, the nation is visited by approximately 14.6 million tourists
            every year (2016), making it the 8th most visited country in the Asia-Pacific.

        <p>Main article: <a href="">Names for India</a></p>
        <p>India is derived from Indus , which originates from the Old Persian word Hindu.The
            latter term stems from the Sanskrit word Sindhu , which was the historical
            local appellation for the Indus River.The ancient Greeks referred to the
            Indians as Indoi which translates as "The people of the Indus".
        </p>
        <p>
            Hindustan Hindi and Urdu Persian name for India dating back to the 3rd
            century BCE. It was introduced into India by the Mughals and widely used since
            then. Its meaning varied, referring to a region that encompassed northern India
            and Pakistan or India in its entirety.Currently, the name may refer to either the
            northern part of India or the entire country.

        <p>The earliest authenticated humanremains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years
            ago. Nearly contemporaneous Mesolithic rock art sites have been found in many parts of the
            Indian subcontinent, including at the Bhimbetka rock shelters in Madhya Pradesh. Around
            7000 BCE, one of the first known Neolithic settlements appeared on the subcontinent in
            Mehrgarh and other sites in the subcontinent.These gradually developed into the Indus Valley
            Civilisation, the first urban culture in South Asia;it flourished during 2500-1900 BCE in
            northeast Afghanistan to Pakistan and northwest India.Centred around cities such as
            Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan , and relying on varied forms of
            subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.

                    <p>In the late Vedic period , around the 6th century BCE, the small states and
                        chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major
                        oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas The emerging urbanisation
                        gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism
                        came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.Buddhism, based on the teachings
                        of Gautama Buddha , attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class;
                        chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.In an
                        age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation
                        as an ideal,and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the
                        3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to
                        emerge as the Mauryan Empire

                    <p>The Indian early medieval age, 600 CE to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms
                        and cultural diversity. When Harsha of Kannauj , who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain
                        from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya
                        ruler of the Deccan.When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated
                        by the Pala king of Bengal When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were
                        defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and
                        the Cholas from still farther south.No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and
                        consistently control lands much beyond his core region. During this time, pastoral peoples
                        whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy were
                        accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.The caste
                        system consequently began to show regional differences.
                        In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the
                        Tamil language.They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of
                        Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent.Indian
                        merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission;
                        South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian
                        seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.

                        and part of the Indo-Australian Plate.India's defining geological processes began 75
                        million years ago when the Indian plate, then part of the southern supercontinent
                        Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west,
                        and later, south and south-east. Simultaneously, the vast Tethyn oceanic crust, to its
                        northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian plate.These dual processes, driven by
                        convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian
                        continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas
                        Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast trough
                        that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain
